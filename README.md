# Position and FlexBox
Basic examples of position and flexBox.

## Position
The **position** css property sets how an element is positioned in a document.

* **static** - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

* **relative** - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom and left.

* **absolute** - The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest **positioned** ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, left, right and bottom.

* **fixed** - The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial **containing block** established by the **viewport**.

* **stick** - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and **containing block**.
